# Initial Data

This is the initial data. It was taken from http://hanzidb.org/

- Characters: http://hanzidb.org/character-list/general-standard
- Radicals: http://hanzidb.org/radicals

The json files have been created using `csv-to-json.js`.

**Note:** the `characters.json` file was later filled with some related words, which was not contained in the `characters.csv` file before. When you re-run the `csv-to-json.js` file, this data will be lost. So be sure what you're doing.
